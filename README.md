MagGen: A Graph-Aided Deep Generative Model for Inverse Design of Permanent Magnets


DiffCrysGen is a score-based diffusion model. It treats the entire materials representation with a single, unified diffusion process, allowing a single denosing neural network to predict a holistic score for the entire noisy crystal data. This unified treatment significantly simplifies the architecture and improves the computational efficiency.
